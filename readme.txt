PURPOSE

Provide UPS connectivity to a single vSphere Hypervisor 5.0 to 7.0
Will shut down properly the host and vms with vmware-tools installed
if a NUT server tells that the power supply has gone and the UPS
battery level is critical.

INSTALL

- Enable SSH on the hypervisor.
- Copy via scp this TAR archive to /tmp directory of the hypervisor
- Connect via ssh to the hypervisor and type the followind commands

    cd /tmp
    tar -xzvf NutClient-ESXi-2.3.0.tar.gz
    ./upsmon-install.sh

- No need to reboot, upsmon can be started immediatly but you need
  to configure it first
- You can delete tmp files and disable SSH on the hypervisor

UPDATE

- Same as install but use ./upsmon-update.sh

UNINSTALL

- Same as install but use ./upsmon-remove.sh

CONFIGURATION

- Start vSphere Client and go to configuration tab of the hypervisor
- Open Advanced Parameters and go to UserVars
- Configure these parameters to match your needs :
   UserVars.NutUpsName    : UPS name on remote NUT server (ups_name@server_name), 
                            can be a space separated list of NUT servers
   UserVars.NutUser       : Username to connect to NUT server. If more that one NUT
                            server is declared, all need to use the same user/password
   UserVars.NutPassword   : Username password on NUT server
   UserVars.NutFinalDelay : Seconds to wait on low battery event before shutting down
   UserVars.NutMinSupplies: Number of power supplies needed to keep the system running
   UserVars.NutSendMail   : Set to 1 if you want a mail to be sent on UPS event
   UserVars.NutMailTo     : Email address to send mail to on UPS event

- If you don't see UserVars parameters restart hostd service on
  hypervisor only if you have no vmware job running
    /etc/init.d/hostd restart
  You will need to reconnect with the client
- Now you can start and enable NUT client on hypervisor boot
- On configuration tab of the hypervisor go to Security Profile
- Open services properties
- Select Network UPS Tools client an click on Options
